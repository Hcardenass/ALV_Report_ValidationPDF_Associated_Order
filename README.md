# ALV_Report_ValidationPDF_Associated_Order

#Problem or Justification:
Currently, there is no mandatory condition that ensures a PDF file is attached when generating an order in the system. This creates problems in audit processes and makes it difficult to trace orders, as it is not obvious which orders have associated documents and which do not.
